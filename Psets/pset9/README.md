#### Description:
This is a website to facilitate the process of entering data for a land transport company that I work for
Large amounts of data are entered daily that determine the type of material, its price, weight, destination, vehicle and driver information, information about the destination and many other information.
In the end, the program shows the desired information in an organized and understandable manner and also performs some arithmetic operations
This is a prototype of the program, which will be continuously developed in the coming days
